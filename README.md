julia-build is a command-line utility that makes it easy to install virtually any
version of Julia, from source.

It is available as a plugin for [jlenv](https://github.com/jlenv/julia-build) that
provides the `jlenv install` command, or as a standalone program.

## Installation

```sh
# As an jlenv plugin
$ mkdir -p "$(jlenv root)"/plugins
$ git clone https://github.com/jlenv/julia-build.git "$(jlenv root)"/plugins/julia-build

# As a standalone program
$ git clone https://github.com/jlenv/julia-build.git
$ PREFIX=/usr/local ./julia-build/install.sh
```

## Upgrading

```sh
# As an jlenv plugin
$ cd "$(jlenv root)"/plugins/julia-build && git pull
```

## Usage

```sh
# As an jlenv plugin
$ jlenv install --list                    # lists all available versions of Julia
$ jlenv install v1.0.1                    # installs Julia v1.0.1 to ~/.jlenv/versions

# As a standalone program
$ julia-build --definitions               # lists all available versions of Julia
$ julia-build 1.0.1 ~/local/julia-v1.0.1  # installs Julia v1.0.1 to ~/local/julia-1.0.1
```

julia-build does not check for system dependencies before downloading and
attempting to compile the Julia source. Please ensure that [all requiredlibraries](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia#required-build-tools-and-external-libraries) 
are available on your system.
The Chef [jlenv](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook) cookbook automatically
ensures system dependencies are in place.

## Documentation

Please see `julia-build` [documentation page](https://julia-build.github.io/docs/README.md) 
for more detail and solutions to common problems.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jlenv/julia-build.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jlenv/julia-build)[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d33f741a507b4cee99ab9d4931ae1163)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/taqtiqa-mark/jlenv-julia-build?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=jlenv/julia-build&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/jlenv/julia-build/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/jlenv/julia-build)

Julia-build is a command-line utility tool that makes it easy to compile,
install and remove virtually any version of [Julia](https://www.julialang.org),
using downloaded source files.

Julia-build is exposed as a plugin for [jlenv](https://github.com/jlenv/julia-build)
that provides the `jlenv install` command.
Or simply as `julia-build` when used as a standalone program.

## Requirements

The Julia build requirements should be inplace, these are elaborated below,
[Suggested build environment](#suggested-build-environment).
Please note, the [jlenv](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook) cookbook
provides the [resources](https://docs.chef.io/resource.html) to setup the
correct build environment and write Julia installation management recipes.

## Installing

```sh
# As an jlenv plugin
mkdir -p "$(jlenv root)"/plugins
git clone https://github.com/jlenv/julia-build.git "$(jlenv root)"/plugins/julia-build

# As a standalone program
git clone https://github.com/jlenv/julia-build.git
PREFIX=/usr/local ./julia-build/install.sh
```

## Upgrading

If you have trouble installing a Julia version, first try to update julia-build to
get the latest bug fixes and Julia definitions.

First locate it on your system:

```sh
which julia-build
ls "$(jlenv root)"/plugins
```

<!---
If it's in `/usr/local/bin` on a Mac, you've probably installed it via
[Homebrew][https:brew.sh]:

```
brew upgrade julia-build
```
--->
Or, if you have it installed via git as an jlenv plugin:

```sh
cd "$(jlenv root)"/plugins/julia-build && git pull
```

## Contributing

Adding a Julia release is as simple as:

1. Identify the Julia [tag](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/release) string.
Example: `v1.1.0-rc2`.
1. Copy one of the files in this rep's folder `share\julia-build`.  Give it
   the tag string as a name: `cp .\share\juila-build\v1.0.0 .\share\juila-build\v1.1.0-rc2`
1. Open the newly created file and replace occurances of `v1.0.0` with `v1.1.0-rc2`

### Running BATS test suite

It is only neccessary to run the [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)
test suite if functionality is added or a bug is fixed.

Please add tests that exercise the functionality added, or guard against the
bug regressions.  To run tests:

```bash
script\test
```

## Notes

### GCC compatibility

Julia is currently built using `gcc-5`.
The Julia build script points this to `gcc`.

### Suggested build environment

Julia-build will try its best to download and compile the wanted Julia version,
but sometimes compilation fails because of unmet system dependencies, or
compilation succeeds but the new Julia version exhibits weird failures at
runtime. The following instructions are our recommendations for a sane build
environment.

* **Chef (zero), etc.:**

  If you don't already, we suggest you manage software installation
  prerequisites, environment and configuration using one of
  [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) ([Zero](https://github.com/chef/chef-zero)),
  [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), [Salt](https://www.saltstack.com),
  [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), etc.
  In the case of [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) ([Zero](https://github.com/chef/chef-zero))
  the [jlenv](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook) cookbook provides the
  [resources](https://docs.chef.io/resource.html) to write Julia installation
  management recipes.

* **macOS:**

  If you haven't done so, install Xcode Command Line Tools
  (`xcode-select --install`) and [Homebrew][https://brew.sh]. Then:

    ```sh
    brew install <package-dependencies>
    ```

    Where the package-dependencies are defined in the [jlenv-cookbook](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook)
    package dependencies [file](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook/blob/master/libraries/package_deps.rb#L38)

* **Ubuntu/Debian/Mint:**

    ```sh
    apt-get install -y <package-dependencies>
    ```

    Where the package-dependencies are defined in the [jlenv-cookbook](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook)
    package dependencies [file](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook/blob/master/libraries/package_deps.rb#L38)

* **CentOS/Fedora:**

    ```sh
    yum install -y <package-dependencies>
    ```

    Where the package-dependencies are defined in the [jlenv-cookbook](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook)
    package [dependencies file](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook/blob/master/libraries/package_deps.rb#L38)

* **openSUSE:**

    ```sh
    zypper install -y <package-dependencies>
    ```

    Where the package-dependencies are defined in the [jlenv-cookbook](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook)
    package dependencies [file](https://github.com/jlenv/jlenv-cookbook/blob/master/libraries/package_deps.rb#L38)

* **Arch Linux:**

## Troubleshooting

***NOTE:***

Julia [README](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) states:
> “Building Julia requires 2GiB of disk space and approximately 4GiB of virtual memory.”

### "mkdir: /Volumes/Macintosh: Not a directory"

This can occur if you have [more than one disk drive](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/issues/748#issuecomment-95143238)
and your home directory is physically mounted on a volume that might have a
space in its name, such as "Macintosh HD":

```sh
$ df
/dev/disk2    ...  /
/dev/disk1s2  ...  /Volumes/Macintosh HD
```

The easiest solution is to avoid building a Julia version to any path that has
space characters in it.
Instead of building into `~/.jlenv/versions/<version>`, which is the default
for `jlenv install <version>`, you could install into `/opt/julias/<version>`
and symlink `/opt/julias` as `~/.jlenv/versions` so jlenv continues to work
as before:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /opt/julias
sudo chown "${USER}:staff" /opt/julias
# THIS WILL DELETE YOUR EXISTING JULIA VERSIONS!
rm -rf ~/.jlenv/versions
ln -s /opt/julias ~/.jlenv/versions
```

Now proceed as following:

```sh
julia-build <version> /opt/julias/<version>
```

### No space left on device

Some distributions will mount a tmpfs partition with low disk space to `/tmp`,
such as 250 MB. You can check this with:

```sh
mount | grep tmp
df -h | grep tmp
```

Compiling Julia can require up to 4 or 5GiB, so you should temporarily
resize `/tmp` to allow more usage:

```sh
rm -rf /tmp/julia-build*
mount -o remount,size=5G,noatime /tmp
```

### Lower the number of parallel jobs

On hosts that report a large amount of CPU cores, but don't have plenty of RAM,
you might get:

```sh
gcc: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1)
```

The solution is to use `MAKE_OPTS=-j2` to limit `make` to maximum of 2 parallel processes:

```bash
export MAKE_OPTS=-j2
```

or also with writable temp directory:

```bash
TMPDIR=~/tmp MAKE_OPTS=-j2 jlenv install 1.0.3
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```sh
# As an jlenv plugin
jlenv install --list                 # lists all available versions of Julia
jlenv install v1.0.1                 # installs Julia v1.0.1 to ~/.jlenv/versions

# As a standalone program
julia-build --definitions               # lists all available versions of Julia
julia-build 1.0.1 ~/local/julia-v1.0.1  # installs Julia v1.0.1 to ~/local/julia-1.0.1
```

`julia-build` does not check for system dependencies before downloading and
attempting to compile the Julia source.
Please ensure that [all required libraries](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia#required-build-tools-and-external-libraries) are available on your system.

### Advanced Usage

#### Custom Build Definitions

If you wish to develop and install a version of Julia that is not yet supported
by `julia-build`, you may specify the path to a custom “build definition file”
in place of a Julia version number.

Use the [default build definitions][jldefs] as a template for your custom
definitions.

#### Custom Build Configuration

The build process may be configured through the following environment variables:

| Variable                 | Function                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TMPDIR`                  | Where temporary files are stored.                                                                |
| `JULIA_BUILD_BUILD_PATH`  | Where sources are downloaded and built. (Default: a timestamped subdirectory of `TMPDIR`)        |
| `JULIA_BUILD_CACHE_PATH`  | Where to cache downloaded package files. (Default: `~/.jlenv/cache` if invoked as jlenv plugin)  |
| `JULIA_BUILD_MIRROR_URL`  | Custom mirror URL root.                                                                          |
| `JULIA_BUILD_SKIP_MIRROR` | Always download from official sources, not mirrors. (Default: unset)                             |
| `JULIA_BUILD_ROOT`        | Custom build definition directory. (Default: `share/julia-build`)                                 |
| `JULIA_BUILD_DEFINITIONS` | Additional paths to search for build definitions. (Colon-separated list)                         |
| `CC`                     | Path to the C compiler.                                                                          |
| `JULIA_CFLAGS`            | Additional `CFLAGS` options (_e.g.,_ to override `-O3`).                                         |
| `CONFIGURE_OPTS`         | Additional `./configure` options.                                                                |
| `MAKE`                   | Custom `make` command (_e.g.,_ `gmake`).                                                         |
| `MAKE_OPTS` / `MAKEOPTS` | Additional `make` options.                                                                       |
| `MAKE_INSTALL_OPTS`      | Additional `make install` options.                                                               |
| `JULIA_CONFIGURE_OPTS`    | Additional `./configure` options (applies only to Julia source).                                 |
| `JULIA_MAKE_OPTS`         | Additional `make` options (applies only to Julia source).                                        |
| `JULIA_MAKE_INSTALL_OPTS` | Additional `make install` options (applies only to Julia source).                                |

#### Applying Patches

Both `jlenv install` and `julia-build` support the `--patch` (`-p`) flag to apply
a patch to the Julia source code before building. Patches are
read from `STDIN`:

```sh
# applying a single patch
jlenv install --patch 1.0.3-p4 < /path/to/julia.patch

# applying a patch from HTTP
jlenv install --patch 1.0.3-p4 < <(curl -sSL http://git.io/julia.patch)

# applying multiple patches
cat fix1.patch fix2.patch | jlenv install --patch 1.0.3-p4
```

#### Checksum Verification

If you have the `shasum`, `openssl`, or `sha256sum` tool installed, julia-build will
automatically verify the SHA2 checksum of each downloaded package before
installing it.

Checksums are optional and specified as anchors on the package URL in each
definition.

#### Keeping the build directory after installation

Both `julia-build` and `jlenv install` accept the `-k` or `--keep` flag, which
tells julia-build to keep the downloaded source after installation. This can be
useful if you need to use `gdb` and `memprof` with Julia.

Source code will be kept in a parallel directory tree `~/.jlenv/sources` when
using `--keep` with the `jlenv install` command. You should specify the
location of the source code with the `JULIA_BUILD_BUILD_PATH` environment
variable when using `--keep` with `julia-build`.

## Definitions

Build definitions are simple shell scripts that get sourced in the `julia-build`
environment so they can invoke functions that fetch necessary packages and
compile them into the destination directory.  The complete list of
[Julia definitions][jldefs]
is here.

The basic invocation from a build definition is the function to download and
install a package from a tarball:

```sh
install_package PACKAGE_NAME PACKAGE_URL#SHA2 [BUILD_STEPS...] [--if CONDITION]
```

`PACKAGE_URL` specifies the location of the tarball where the package is
published. After download, its signature verified against the optional SHA2
checksum.

`PACKAGE_NAME` is the name of the directory to `cd` into after extracting the
tarball. The subsequent `BUILD_STEPS` will be executed within that directory.

`BUILD_STEPS` is a list of operations to run in order to complete the installation
of a Julia version. If empty, the list defaults to "standard".

`CONDITION` is a way to specify that this package is optional and will only be
installed if the function of the name `CONDITION` returns a success status. Some
condition functions available to built-in definitions are:

* **needs_yaml**: true if there isn't an adequate libyaml found on the system
* **has_broken_mac_openssl**: true for Apple-patched openssl v0.9.8

Alternatively, a package may be retrieved via git or SVN:

```sh
install_git PACKAGE_NAME GIT_URL BRANCH [...]
install_svn PACKAGE_NAME SVN_URL REVISION [...]
```

### Build steps

#### Pre-build steps

* **ldflags_dirs**: Ensures that directories listed in `LDFLAGS` exist.
* **auto_tcltk**: Detects XQuartz on OS X or disables TK.
* **autoconf**: Runs `autoconf`. Prerequisite for "standard" step when fetching
  Julia versions from git/SVN.

#### Build steps

* **standard**: `./configure` + `make`. This is the default.
* **topaz**: copies over pre-built Topaz.
* **julia**: `julia setup.jl`. Used when installing Julia Packages.
* **mac_openssl**: builds OpenSSL on OS X.

#### Post-build steps

* **verify_openssl**: Checks that openssl extension can be loaded.

### Constraints

These constraints should appear in the beginning of the build definition to
check whether the system is compatible with the Julia version:

* **require_gcc**: ensures that gcc is gcc-5. Required check for all Julia.

### Hooks

Before and after installing each package, julia-build invokes these functions:

```sh
before_install_package PACKAGE_NAME
after_install_package PACKAGE_NAME
```

You can take advantage of this by defining these functions in the definition
itself and filtering by package name as necessary.  Example:

```sh
before_install_package() {
  local package_name="$1"
  case "$package_name" in
  julia-* )
    # do something for all Julia packages
    ;;
  esac
}

install_package ...
```
